A Logistic Company Data Analysis - Feature Engineering

About the Logistic Company
The company stands as a key player in the logistics industry, holding the title of the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated entity in India 
by revenue as of Fiscal 2021. With a vision to construct the operating system for commerce, they amalgamate top-tier infrastructure, 
superior logistics operations, and leading-edge engineering and technology capabilities. 
The Data team plays a pivotal role, harnessing this data to bridge the gap between quality, efficiency, and profitability in comparison to competitors.

Problem Statement
The company is keen on unraveling insights from the data generated by their robust data engineering pipelines. The specific challenges include:

1. Data Processing and Understanding: Clean, sanitize, and manipulate data to derive meaningful features from raw fields. Make sense of raw data and
   facilitate the data science team in constructing forecasting models.
2. Row Aggregation and Feature Extraction: Due to the division of delivery details into multiple rows, akin to connecting flights, there is a need to determine
   the appropriate treatment for these rows. Utilize functions like groupby and aggregations (e.g., sum(), cumsum()) based on Trip_uuid, Source ID,
   and Destination ID. Further aggregate based solely on Trip_uuid, considering the first and last values for selected numeric/categorical fields.
3. Basic Data Cleaning and Exploration: Address missing values in the data to ensure completeness. Analyze the fundamental structure of the data.
Merge rows using the hinted techniques to provide a consolidated view of delivery details.
4. Feature Engineering: Extract valuable features to prepare the data for subsequent analysis.
  * Derive insights from Destination Name and Source Name by splitting and extracting city, place, code, and state information.
  * Leverage Trip_creation_time to extract temporal features such as month, year, and day.
5. In-Depth Analysis and Insight Generation:
  * Calculate the time taken between od_start_time and od_end_time, introducing a new feature while potentially removing the original columns.
  * Perform comparative analyses, including the difference between Point A and start_scan_to_end_scan.
  * Conduct hypothesis testing or visual analysis between various aggregated values obtained after merging rows based on Trip_uuid.
6. Outlier Handling and Feature Transformation:
  * Identify and handle outliers in numerical variables, employing methods like the IQR method.
  * Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables, such as route_type.
  * Normalize/Standardize numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
